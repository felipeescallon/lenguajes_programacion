These files are in Adobe Reader format. If you do not have Adobe Reader version 3.0.1 or newer installed, you can install it from the installation files provided on this CD in the Acrobat directory,or from Adobe Systems at www.adobe.com.Both files contain a complete nested table of contents using thethumbnail feature of Adobe Reader. You can use the thumbnails tofind a section of the document and then click on a thumbnail toopen the corresponding page in the viewer. The thumbnails arefound on the left pane, which can be resized if necessary.Both files contain extensive cross-references.A cross-reference can be clicked to show the target page.In addition, the tables of contents and the indexes in thebooks have entries that can be clicked to show the target reference.In the UML Reference Manual, cross-references are indicated inmagenta text. Figure captions, table references, and bibliographicreferences can also be clicked for traversal. Note that the annotations on diagrams in the notation appendix are also cross-references.The cross-references in the OMG UML specification document are notshown in a different color, but most apparent cross-references canbe clicked for traversal.Readers are also encouraged to use the text search features ofAdobe Acrobat Reader to find information in either document.The text of the UML Reference Manual is provided in an online formas a convenience to purchasers of the book and may not be printed,copied, or made available on a network or web server.For information about the book or similar books, see theAddison-Wesley computer science web page at www.awl.com/cseng.The text of the OMG UML specification documents is provided with the permission of the Object Management Group, Inc.
