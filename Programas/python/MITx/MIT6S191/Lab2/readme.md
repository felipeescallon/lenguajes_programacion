# MIT 6.S191 Lab 2: Computer Vision

My solution to the "TO-DO" exercises for Part 1 and 2 of Lab2

Lab2 has been addressed by four main topics:

- *Fully-connected Neural Networks (**NN**)* to adress digit classification
- *Convolutional Neural Networks (**CNN**)* to improve digit classification, and to be able to classify an image as: `face image` or `non-face image`
- *Variational AutoEncoder (**VAR**)* for learning latent structure 
- *DeBiasing Variational AutoEncoder (DB-VAE)* in order to mitigate `bias` in classifying face images


# Part 1: MNIST Digit Classification

MNIST classifiers with different architectures: *fully-connected NN .vs. Convolutional NN*



# Part 2: Debiasing Facial Detection Systems

Algorithmic bias: VAE, DB-VAE
